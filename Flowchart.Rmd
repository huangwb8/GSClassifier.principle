# The Principle of GSClassifier


## Introduction

[GSClassifier](https://github.com/huangwb8/GSClassifier) is an R package for modeling and identification of gene expression profiles (GEPs) subtypes. The detail of usage had been demonstrated in [Github WiKi](https://github.com/huangwb8/GSClassifier/wiki). Here, we propose to introduce the principle of GSClassifier, including flowchart, **top scoring pairs (TSP)** algorithm, and batch effect control.

## Flowchart

The flowchart of **GSClassifier** is showed in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart). 补充一些内容，说明一下图的框架。

```{r echo=FALSE, flowchart, fig.cap='The flow chart of GSClassifier', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("./fig/flowchart.png", 1))
```


## Data Processing

For each dataset, the RNA expression matrix would be normalized (we called **Raw Matrix** in the flowchart) internally so that the expression data of the samples in the dataset were comparable. 

Next, the subtypes of the samples in each dataset would be called based on cluster analysis. Specially, we figured out PAD subtypes, which belong to **Subtype Vector** in the flowchart, via hierarchical clustering analysis.

## Simulated Dataset

First, load needed packages:

```{r}

# Install "devtools" package
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")

# Install dependencies
if (!requireNamespace("luckyBase", quietly = TRUE))
  devtools::install_github("huangwb8/luckyBase")

# Install the "GSClassifier" package
if (!requireNamespace("GSClassifier", quietly = TRUE))
  devtools::install_github("huangwb8/GSClassifier")

# Install the "pacman" package
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("pacman")
  library(pacman)
} else {
  library(pacman)
}

# Load needed packages
packages_needed <- c(
  "readxl",
  "ComplexHeatmap",
  "GSClassifier",
  "rpart",
  "tidyr")
for(i in packages_needed){p_load(char=i)}

```

We simulated a dataset:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Geneset
geneSet <- list(
  Set1 = paste('Gene',1:3,sep = ''),
  Set2 = paste('Gene',4:6,sep = '')
)

# RNA expression
x <- read_xlsx('./data/simulated-data.xlsx', sheet = 'RNA')
expr0 <- as.matrix(x[,-1])
rownames(expr0) <- as.character(as.matrix(x[,1])); rm(x)

# Parameters
breakVec = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
subtype_vector = c(1,1,1,2,2,2)
Ybin = ifelse(subtype_vector == 1, yes = 1, no=0)

# Report
cat(c('\n', 'Gene sets:', '\n'))
print(geneSet)
cat('RNA expression:', '\n')
print(expr0)

```

Look at the matrix via heatmap:

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
Heatmap(t(scale(t(expr0))), name = "Z-score")
```


This is an intersting dataset with features as following:

+ **Distinguished gene sets**: The expression profile between **Gene 1-3** and **Gene 4-6** is obviously different arross samples. Thus, these gene sets might represent different biology meaning.

+ **Stable gene**: The expression level and rank of **Gene 7** seemed to be similar across samples. Thus, **Gene 7** might not be a robust marker for subtype modeling. Thus, it could help us to understand how filtering of **GSClassifier** works.

+ **Expression heterogeneity & rank homogeneity**: Take **Sample1** and **Sample3** as examples. The expression of **Gene 1-6** in **Sample3** seemed to be higher than those of **Sample1**. However, the expression of **Gene 1-3** is higher than **Gene 4-6** in both **Sample1** and **Sample3**, indicating similar bioprocess in these samples exists so that they should be classified as the same subtype.

## Missing values

Here, we fill missing value with Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART) algorithm:

```{r}
# RPART
expr <- GSClassifier:::na_fill(expr0, method="anova", na.action = na.rpart)

# Report
cat('RNA expression:', '\n')
print(expr0)
cat('\n')
cat('RNA expression without NA value:', '\n')
print(expr)
```

Look at the new matrix via heatmap, where the clustering result is not obviously disturbed by **NA** filling:

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
Heatmap(t(scale(t(expr))), name = "Z-score")
```

Although RPART algorithm is proved to be powerful dealing with NA value, we should try to use markers with less NA as possible. During PAD subtype establishment, only genes occurring in over 80% of datasets were retained so as to minumize the impact from mising value.

## Top scoring pairs (TSP)

With **subtype vectors** and **Raw Matrix**, the TSP matrix for a specified subtypes could be calculated via function `GSClassifier::trainDataProc`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
trainDataProc(
  Xmat, Yvec,
  
  geneSet, 

  subtype = 1, 
  
  # 0.2 was Used in PAD project
  ptail = 0.2,
  
  # c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) was Used in PAD project
  breakVec = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
)
```

As show in Figure \@ref(fig:tsp), The TSP matrix consists of 3 parts: **binned expression**, **pair difference**, and **set difference**. Next, we would use a simulated dataset to introduce **how TSP matrix calculated in GSClassifier**. 

```{r echo=FALSE, tsp, fig.cap='The components of TSP (2 gene sets)', out.width='85%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("./fig/TSP.png", 1))
```


### Binned expression

First, we binned genes with diffrent quantile intervals so that the distribution of rank information could be more consistent across samples.

Take **Sample4** as an example:

```{r}

# Data of Sample4

x <- expr[,4]

# Create quantiles  
brks <- quantile(as.numeric(x), 
                 probs=breakVec, 
                 na.rm = T)

# Get interval orders
xbin <- .bincode(x = x, 
                 breaks = brks, 
                 include.lowest = T)
xbin <- as.numeric(xbin)
names(xbin) <- names(x)

# Report
cat('Quantiles:', '\n'); print(brks)
cat('\n')
cat('Raw expression:', '\n');print(x)
cat('\n')
cat('Binned expression:', '\n'); print(xbin)
```

For example, **0.110** is the minimun of the raw expression vector, so its binned expression is **1**. Similarly, the binned expression of maximum **0.530** is **4**.  

Generally, we calculate binned expression via function **breakBin** of **GSClassifier**:

```{r}
expr_binned <- apply(
  expr, 2, 
  GSClassifier:::breakBin,
  breakVec)
rownames(expr_binned) <- rownames(expr)
print(expr_binned)
```

In this simulated dataset, **Gene7** is a gene whose expression is always the lowest across all samples. In other words, the rank of **Gene7** is stable or invariable across samples so that it's not robust for identification of differentail subtypes. 

Except binned expression, we also calculated pair difference later. Due to the number of gene pair is $C_{2 \atop n}$, the removement of genes like **Gene7** before modeling could really reduce the complexibility and save computing resources. In all, genes with low rank difference should be dropped out in some extent in **GSClassifier**.

First, We use **base::rank** to return the sample ranks of the values in a vector:

```{r}
expr_binned_rank <- apply(
  expr_binned, 2, 
  function(x)rank(x, na.last = TRUE)
)
print(expr_binned_rank)
```

Then, get weighted average rank difference of each gene based on specified subtype distribution (**Ybin**):

```{r}
testRes <- sapply(
  1:nrow(expr_binned_rank), 
  function(gi){
    
    # Rank vector of each gene
    rankg = expr_binned_rank[gi,];
    
    # Weighted average rank difference of a gene for specified subtype 
    # Here is subtype 1 vs. others
    (sum(rankg[Ybin == 0], na.rm = T) / sum(Ybin == 0, na.rm = T)) - 
    (sum(rankg[Ybin == 1], na.rm = T) / sum(Ybin == 1, na.rm = T))
  }
)
names(testRes) <- rownames(expr_binned_rank)
print(testRes)
```

**Gene7** is the one with the lowest absolute value (0) of rank diffrence. By the way, **Gene 1-3** have the same direction (<0), so do **Gene 4-6** (>0), which indicates the nature of clustering based on these two gene sets.

In practice, we use **ptail** to select differential genes based on rank diffrences. **Smaller ptail is, less gene kept**. Here, we just set **ptail=0.4**:

```{r}

# ptail is a numeber ranging (0,0.5].
ptail = 0.4

# Index of target genes with big rank differences
idx <- which((testRes < quantile(testRes, ptail, na.rm = T)) | 
             (testRes > quantile(testRes, 1.0-ptail, na.rm = T)))

# Target genes
gene_bigRank <- names(testRes)[idx]

# Report
cat('Index of target genes: ','\n');print(idx); cat('\n')
cat('Target genes:','\n');print(gene_bigRank)
```

Hence, **Gene7** was filtered and excluded in the following analysis. By the way, both **ptail** and **breakVec** are hyperparameters in GSClassifier modeling.

### Pair difference

In GSClassifier, we use a ensemble function **featureSelection** to select data for pair difference scoring.

```{r}
expr_feat <- featureSelection(expr, Ybin,
                              testRes = testRes,
                              ptail = 0.4)

expr_sub <- expr_feat$Xsub
gene_bigRank <- expr_feat$Genes

# Report
cat('Raw xpression without NA:', '\n')
print(expr_sub)
cat('\n')
cat('Genes with large rank diff:', '\n')
print(gene_bigRank)
```

In GSClassifier, we use function **makeGenePairs** to calculate s

```{r}
gene_bigRank_pairs <- GSClassifier:::makeGenePairs(
  gene_bigRank, 
  expr[gene_bigRank,])
print(gene_bigRank_pairs)
```

Take **Gene1:Gene4** of **Sample1** as an example. $Expression_{Gene1} - Expression_{Gene4} = 0.51-0.21 = 0.3 > 0$, so the pair score is 1. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, the pair score is 0. In addition, the difference of gene pair scoring between **Sample 1-3** and **Sample 4-6** is obivous, revealing the robustness of pair difference for subtype identification.

### Set difference

In **GSClassifier**, **Set difference** is defined as a weight average of gene-geneset rank difference. 

```{r}
# No. of gene sets
nGS = 2

# Name of gene set comparision, which is like s1s2, s1s3 and so on.
featureNames <- 's1s2'

# Gene set difference across samples
resultList <- list()
for (i in 1:ncol(expr_sub)) { # i=1
  res0 <- numeric(length=length(featureNames))
  idx <- 1
  for (j1 in 1:(nGS-1)) { # j1=1
    for (j2 in (j1+1):nGS) { # j2=2
      
      # If j1=1 and j2=2, gene sets s1/s2 would be selected
      
      # Genes of different gene sets
      set1 <- geneSet[[j1]] # "Gene1" "Gene2" "Gene3"
      set2 <- geneSet[[j2]] # "Gene4" "Gene5" "Gene6"
      
      # RNA expression of Genes by different gene sets
      vals1 <- expr_sub[rownames(expr_sub) %in% set1,i]
      # Gene1 Gene2 Gene3
      # 0.51  0.52  0.53
      vals2 <- expr_sub[rownames(expr_sub) %in% set2,i]
      # Gene4 Gene5 Gene6
      # 0.21  0.22  0.23

      # Differences between one gene and gene sets
      # Compare expression level of each gene in Set1 with all genes in Set2. 
      # For example, 0.51>0.21/0.22/0.23, so the value of Gene1:s2 is 3.
      res1 <- sapply(vals1, function(v1) sum(v1 > vals2, na.rm=T))
      # Gene1:s2   Gene2:s2   Gene3:s2
      # 3          3           3
      
      # Weight average of gene-geneset rank difference
      res0[idx] <- sum(res1, na.rm = T) / (length(vals1) * length(vals2))
      
      # Next gene set pair
      idx <- idx + 1
    }
  }
  resultList[[i]] <- as.numeric(res0)
}
resMat <- do.call(cbind, resultList)
colnames(resMat) <- colnames(expr_sub)
rownames(resMat) <- featureNames

# Report 
cat('Set difference across samples: ', '\n')
print(resMat)
```

In **GSClassifier**, we established **makeSetData** to evaluate set difference across samples:

```{r}

# Gene set difference across samples
geneset_interaction <- GSClassifier:::makeSetData(expr_sub, geneSet)

# Report 
cat('Set difference across samples: ', '\n')
print(resMat)

```
We have known that the subtype of **Sample 1-3** differs from that of **Sample 4-6**, which revealed the robustness of set difference for subtype indentification.
